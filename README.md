Code used for simulation studies when analysing a joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data in a group sequential trial design.


Please run the R-script "run_simulations.R"
Results in the main paper are given for different values of the variables gamma, phi2 and sigma_sq.
The number of simulations has been set to N=50 for convenience. This allows the script to be run in under an hour. For accurate results, please increase the number of simulations to N=10^4.
